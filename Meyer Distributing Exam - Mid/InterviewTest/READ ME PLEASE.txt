-)Hello to whoever is reviewing this code.
-)My name's Sarim.
-)Thank you for the opportunity.
-)The code was not tricky it just took me some time to understand what's going on.
-)I had to add a few things of my own which you may find is different from the classes you were using.
-)Am really not familiar with using interfaces so had to make a struct for return and orders table.
-)I was not sure if you wanted me to use entity framework for handling database queries or stored procedure so I didn't take a shortcut lol,
  and went with doing sql stored procedures.
-)I am done with all the tasks except for unit testing as its kinda getting late to submit the project.
-)Also you may have to change the connection string for localDB
-)Please let me know if you have any further questons.
-)Thank you again :)
